 Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
    -Methods like GET and post
    -routing 

 Describe Middleware?
    -Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

 Describe a Resource?
    -RESTful API = A resource is an object with a type, associated data, relationships to other resources, and a set of methods that operate on it.
    REpresentational State Transfer = rest


 What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
    -the codes like 200 or 404 

 How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
    -it would be the pathing like if you need to test tto things you wouldn't be able to use the same name so you put them in two diff. files.
